# Cracking_the_Coding_Interview_Yuji-s_Approach

Welcome to my repository for practising coding interview questions based on "Cracking the Coding Interview." This repository is organized to help you work through problems from the book, with solutions implemented primarily in Java, and potentially in Rust in the future.

Repository Structure
Folders: Each chapter from the book is represented in its own folder, containing sample solutions to the questions posed in that chapter.
Languages: Currently, solutions are provided in Java, with the possibility of adding Rust solutions later.
Unit Tests: Each solution is accompanied by unit tests to ensure correctness and reliability.
Approach
Selective Focus: I will attempt almost all questions, but may skip some if they seem irrelevant or if similar questions have already been solved on LeetCode.
Chapter Selection: Some chapters may be skipped to focus on the most relevant aspects of the interview process.
